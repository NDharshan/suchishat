# Suchishat
## Event Management and Crowd-Funding System

## The problem Suchishat solves

This is an application to streamline the process of Event management by providing an easy interface for a host to post details about the event to bridge the gap in communication and also bring transparency in the persisting problem in the expenses i.e. the funds raised, spent and residuals. Few volunteers managing the program implies there is no ways to handle crowds from the logistics point of view and track expenses in a transparent manner and the probability of unwittingly committed errors and the requirement of RSVP and its importance in Food and travel costs. Also the necessity of documentation and accountability of the reminder of funds left.

## Challenges we ran into

We wish to extend this project into Polygon and use Filecoin further store and work with data. *We found the tutorial on ethereum-react by hackernoon really useful in tackling the same and have ourselves personally built on and have been greatly inspired by their work*

Technologies used
